# Feature-First Architecture Guidelines

This skill provides guidelines for structuring the project using a Feature-First Architecture.

## Component Placement Logic

Always follow this decision tree to determine the directory:

1.  **components/ui/**:
    *   If the component is pure UI, 100% prop-driven, and has **NO hooks** (e.g., Button, Card, Input).

2.  **components/shared/**:
    *   If the component contains hooks/logic (e.g., `useTheme`, `useTranslations`) **AND** is shared by **2 or more features** (e.g., Header, ThemeToggle).

3.  **features/[name]/components/**:
    *   If the component is specific to a single business domain or feature (e.g., ProjectCard, SkillBadge).

## Quick Decision Table

| Characteristics | Directory |
| :--- | :--- |
| Pure UI & No Hooks | `components/ui/` |
| Used by 2+ Features | `components/shared/` |
| Business Specific | `features/[name]/components/` |

## Export Rules

*   **Named Exports**: Always use named exports (e.g., `export const MyComponent...`) to facilitate IDE auto-imports.
