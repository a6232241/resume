  "This is a music player application that allows users to listen to music and store music lists locally, ensuring that music can be played without an internet connection. It also provides a filtering function, allowing users to filter music by artist, music category, music name, etc.\n\nDevelopment was motivated by the fact that most music players on the market do not have a filtering function, and unstable networks can cause music to be interrupted.\n\nThe project uses Expo for development, SQLite as a local database, Node.js as the backend, and Express.js to backup the database and music files.\n\nIn the future, it is expected to use Google Drive or other cloud storage services for backup to provide a better user experience.": "This is a music player application that allows users to listen to music and store music lists locally, ensuring that music can be played without an internet connection.

  "This is a simple 2D face swap application, allowing users to replace their face with another person's face. Initially, the manager wanted to use existing streaming platforms to let users switch faces in real-time, but due to the performance of current mobile phones or personal computers, it was too difficult to achieve. Therefore, traditional mathematical formulas were used to implement the face swap logic. This project was developed using React Native and implemented the face swap logic using native modules Kotlin, Objective-C, C++, and OpenCV.": "This is a simple 2D face swap application, allowing users to replace their face with another person's face.
