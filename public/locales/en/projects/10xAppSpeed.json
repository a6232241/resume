Leveraged Flipper and React DevTools to pinpoint root causes: excessive global re-renders and redundant API state resets. After assessing maintenance costs and risks, I upgraded Redux Toolkit and implemented createSelector memoization, ultimately reducing login time by 90% and significantly smoothing multi-page navigation.",
